## Problem-Solving Techniques

1. **Prefix Sum**
   - Frequently used for range-based problems to optimize summation queries.

2. **Two Pointer**
   - Ideal for solving problems involving arrays or linked lists with a linear traversal.

3. **Sliding Window**
   - Efficient for problems involving subarrays or substrings, especially for maintaining a dynamic window of elements.

4. **Fast & Slow Pointer**
   - Useful for detecting cycles in linked lists or arrays.

5. **Linked List In-Place Reversal**
   - Commonly used in reversing or modifying linked lists without extra space.

6. **Monotonic Stack**
   - Suitable for problems involving spans, ranges, or maintaining a sequence of elements in sorted order.

7. **Top 'k' Elements**
   - Frequently solved using heaps or priority queues.

7. **Quick Select**
   - Efficient for finding the k-th smallest or largest element in an unsorted array.

8. **Overlapping Intervals**
   - Deals with merging or finding intersections of intervals.

9. **Modified Binary Search**
   - Extends binary search for use cases beyond simple element searches, such as finding peaks or minimums in rotated arrays.

10. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
    - Recursive or stack-based traversal for exploring all possible paths in graphs or trees.

11. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
    - Queue-based traversal for finding shortest paths or level-order traversal in graphs or trees.

12. **Matrix Traversal**
    - Techniques for navigating grids, often combined with BFS or DFS.

13. **Backtracking**
    - Used for solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as permutations, combinations, and puzzles.

14. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    - Breaks problems into overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure to improve efficiency.
